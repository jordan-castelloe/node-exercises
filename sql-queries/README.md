## SQL Queries

## Instructions

1. Open up the database file in the *DB Browser for SQLite* application to see it
1. Copy and paste the queries below into your `queries.sql` file and comment them out. Then you can write a query for each requrement and refer back to them later as a resource
1. When you have written a query, paste it into DB Browser and test it by clicking the tab labeled "Execute SQL"

For each of the following exercises, provide the appropriate query. Everything from class and the [Sqlite](http://www.sqlite.org/) documentation for SQL [keywords](https://www.sqlite.org/lang.html) and [functions](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_corefunc.html) is fair game.
