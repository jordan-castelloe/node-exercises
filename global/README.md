## Global Object
An early assignment to practice accessing the global process object in Node.js (and practice ES6 tricks!) for Nashville Software School

### [Instructions](https://github.com/jordan-castelloe/global-object)

Create a JavaScript file to act as a Node.js program named `global.js`. The file
should contain JavaScript code to output detailed `version` information of Node.js
and the underlying V8 JavaScript engine to the terminal using the `process`
global object. In addition, the program should be able to directly execute.

Expected:

```bash
$ ./global.js
Node.js version: v6.3.1
V8 version: 5.0.71.57
```

## Bonus

-   Use an ES6 Template Literal and its string interpolation feature
-   Use a single call to `console.log`
-   Use ES6 Destructuring Assignment to extract the two variables from the
    `versions` object

## To Run
In your terminal, run:
- `` git clone ``
- `` npm install ``
- `` chmod +x ./global.js ``

To execute the file, run:
- ``.\global.js``
