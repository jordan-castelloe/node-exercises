## Third Party Modules (Flag)

### Requirements

For this exercise we are going to use a popular Node.js module: [chalk][chalk]

Create a JavaScript file to act as a Node.js program named `flag.js`. This program
print out a red, white, and blue American flag in the terminal. The stars should
be white bold text with a blue background, the red stripes should be spaces with
a red background, and the white stripes should be spaces with a white
background.

Because of the limitations of the terminal, don't worry about getting all 50
stars exactly as they are on the official flag. However, make sure all 13
stripes are on the flag. Additionally make the flag 50 characters wide and have
1 space of padding before and after the stars.

Use the following format below.

Expected:

```bash
$ ./flag.js
```
