## Requirements

Create a JavaScript file to act as a Node.js program named `streams.js`. This program
should read a file `languages.json` and output to a file `languages_caps.json`. Use the second
command-line argument to declare the destination. You will not need to make your own `Readable` for this exercise. Simply use
[`fs.createReadStream`][createreadstream] instead. In between, all letters
should be capitalized with your own `Transform` stream. Then the data should be passed to your own `Writable` stream. The [`fs.appendFile`][appendfile] will be helpful
for this task.

In addition, use some other method in the `fs` module make sure executing the
program multiple times does not continue making a larger and larger
`09.Caps.json` file.

Expected:

```bash
$ cat 09.json
{
  "languages": {
    "JavaScript": "Awesome",
    "C++": "Difficult",
    "BASIC": "Old"
  }
}
$ ./09.js 09_Caps.json
$ cat 09_Caps.json
{
  "LANGUAGES": {
    "JAVASCRIPT": "AWESOME",
    "C++": "DIFFICULT",
    "BASIC": "OLD"
  }
}
```

## Bonus

-   ES6 Object Destructuring

## To Run
- `` git clone ``
- `` chmod +x ./stream.js languages.json languages_caps.json``
- ``./stream.js languages.json languages_caps.json``
- `` cat languages_caps.json ``
- You should see the languages in all capital letters!
